# Hoi Polloi

Hoi Polloi was an early college project created by myself and a fellow classmate and future friend. The idea was 
originally his and the goal was to port his PHP version to Java, this is the progress we achieved before we decided to
end work on the project in lieu of more popular web offerings at the time.
