# Hoi Polloi

Hoi Polloi was an early college project created by @bbuck and a fellow classmate and future friend, @pyrite357. The idea was 
originally @pyrite357's and the goal was to port his PHP version to Java, this is the progress they achieved before they decided to end work on the project in lieu of more popular web offerings at the time.
